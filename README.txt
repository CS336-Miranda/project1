Important notes:

* Please test application in Mozilla based browser such as Chrome or Edge. The built-in Eclipse browser isn't able to handle or render the pages properly.
* Checklist and Project requirements varied in terms of who should set bid increments (seller vs buyer). Based on systems like eBay, we configured it so the
buyer sets the bid increment. Seller sets the initial price and minimum reserve price.
* In the top navigation menu, all the way to the right, you will see the logged in user's email address with a dropdown (staying in line with standard web design
practice). My Alerts, My Watch List, Log Out and Delete Account links are located in this account-specific dropdown.
